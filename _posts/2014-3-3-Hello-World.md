title: You're up and running!

Let us start with a small introduction. My name is Alain Pimentel and currently I'm a Math and Computer Science Student at Southern Adventist University.

Now, I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now. However, school work and internship has left me with little to no time for my own projects! 

And then _github.io_ came. Really, a great tool to start something fast and convenient! Github user also has a great repo to get started with Jekyll templating.

And so, expect posts about sofware development, Android, LaTex, ASOIAF, and other non-sense.
