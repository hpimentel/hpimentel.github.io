title: Android Malware and Machine Learning
---

For my Senior Seminar class I decided to research a technique to detect Android malware, specifically, unknown Android Malware. Upon my research, I came across with different techniques to detect Malware. The one technique that seemed to have the best results was using machine learning classification algorithms.

A [study](http://securelist.com/analysis/kaspersky-security-
bulletin/58335/mobile-malware-evolution-2013/) in 2014 showed that 98.05% of malware detected targeted Android, and the most probable cause of this high number is [Android's popularity](http://www.emarketer.com/Article/2-Billion-Consumers-Worldwide-Smartphones-by-2016/1011694) (1.5 billion apps are downloaded from the Google Play Store every month).

In my paper I go into the detail of the different techniques researchers have used to detect unknown Android malware and I also propose extending an existing framework to detect Android malware. My framework proposes using an existing method to extract features and using an ensemble classifier in order to improve the accuracy of malware detection (see an overview of my framework below).

You can download my paper [here]({{ site.url }}/images/2015-5-19/researchpaper.pdf). I hope it gives you more light on how you can use machine learning to classify apps.
