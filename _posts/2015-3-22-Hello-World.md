title: Hello, World!
---

Let us start with a small introduction. My name is Alain Pimentel and currently I'm a Math and Computer Science Student at Southern Adventist University.

Now, I've been meaning to start a blog for a while now. However, school work and internship has left me with little to no time for my own projects! 

And then _github.io_ came. Really, a great tool to start something fast and convenient! Github user also has a great repo to get started with Jekyll templating.

And so, expect posts about software development, Android, LaTex, ASOIAF, Barcelona, and other non-sense.

In the mean time, check this awesome goal by Luis Suárez at today's _Clásico_. Visca el Barça!
