I left my country when I was 16 years old to pursue an American education. I graduate in May 2015 and I've had an amazing experience so far.

Now, I have always been a big Math fan and I always saw myself in the math field. That was until I took one programming class and found that my passion was not limited to just Math. Exploring the world of Computer Science has been very enlightening and now I am very interested in Android and web development.

I enjoy the outdoors and soccer, but nothing beats reading a good article, book, or solving that problem that kept me awake all night! My dream has just started and I am ready to get out there to solve, code, and explore.

### Experience
#### Software Developer Intern | Center for Innovation and Research in Computing at Southern Adventist University | April 2014 - Present
In the year I have been an intern, I have been involved in several projects. Here is some of the most remarkable ones:

1. Android
* **ShareHim Android:** First Android app during my internship. As a group project, I helped develop the upload feature of the app. I implemented a way for the user to upload files to a server. The uploads happen in the background and can be stop and resumed later. I also implemented a way to view the images and the sound recorded by the app as if it was a video. It gave experience on Android UI as well. 
*  **FFMPEG:** In order to test if our mobile devices could handle encoding videos, I was given the tast to test FFMPEG on Android. I developed an app using a FFMPEG library to change a video's resolution and frame rate.
* **Devoted:** This was a solo project and it involved fetching a RSS Feed from a server and creating a list of devotionals that users can read online and offline. The project was done for Android and it involved using external libraries such as _Picasso_.

2. Web
*I worked on 2 LAMP web apps. In the first app I developed a chat-like feature, the admin site, the encoding of files using FFMPEG in the server, and the integration of a video player to watch the encoded videos. I used JavaScript, jQueyr, HTML/CSS for the front-end features.
For the second app, I used Bootstrap to develop a highschool's online application forms. I also added online payment support with Stripe.

I used git for all the projects through Bitbucket and Github. I also learn to manage the Linux server we use.
