I left my country when I was 16 years old to pursue and American education. This past May 10, 2015 I graduated with a BS in Computer Science and Mathematics. During college I was able to apply my passion for problem solving into programming, which has quickly become one of my passions. When I'm not coding, you will find me climbing, playing soccer, or talking about Game of Thrones!

### Experience
#### Software Developer Intern | Center for Innovation and Research in Computing at Southern Adventist University | April 2014 - Present
In the year I have been an intern, I have been involved in several projects. Here is some of the most remarkable ones:

1. Android
  * **ShareHim Android:** First Android app during my internship. As a group project, I helped develop the upload feature of the app. I implemented a way for the users to upload files to a server. The uploads happen in the background and can be stop and resumed later. I also implemented a way to view the images and the sound recorded by the app as if it was a video. It gave experience on Android UI as well. 
  *  **FFMPEG:** In order to test if our mobile devices could handle encoding videos, I was given the tast to test FFMPEG on Android. I developed an app using a FFMPEG library to change a video's resolution and frame rate.
  * **Devoted:** This was a solo project and it involved fetching a RSS Feed from a server and creating a list of devotionals that users can read online and offline. The project was done for Android and it involved using external libraries such as _Picasso_. [Devoted for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.southern.cs.circ.devoted).

2. Web
  * I worked on two LAMP web apps. In the first app I developed a chat-like feature, the admin site, the encoding of files using FFMPEG in the server, and the integration of a video player to watch the encoded videos. I used JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS for the front-end features.
  For the second app, I used Bootstrap to develop a highschool's online application forms. I also added online payment support with Stripe.

I used git for all the projects through Bitbucket and Github. I also learn to manage the Linux server we use.

### Other Projects
I got to use different technologies for different projects during school. I created a tv show tracker using asp.NET. I also worked on a team/agile based Android app for a Software Engineer class. One of my favorite frameworks is Flask, which I used for my senior project: [meta.alainp.me](meta.alainp.me).

### Buzzwords
I learned programming with **C++** and I used some **Python**, **Scala** and **.Ne**t for a couple projects. I started writing code in my internship with **Java** and **PHP**. I also have experience with **MySQL** and **Linux**. The nature of my work led me to also work on some front-end features with **jQuery**, **HTML/CSS** and **Twitter's Bootstrap**.
