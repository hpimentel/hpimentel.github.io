I left my country when I was 16 years old to pursue an American education. I graduate in May 2015 and I've had an amazing experience so far.

Now, I have always been a big Math fan and I always saw myself in the math field. That was until I took one programming class and found that my passion was not limited to just Math. Exploring the world of Computer Science has been very enlightening and now I am very interested in Android and web development.

I enjoy the outdoors and soccer, but nothing beats reading a good article, book, or solving that problem that kept me awake all night! My dream has just started and I am ready to get out there to solve, code, and explore.

In the year I have been an intern, I have been involved in several projects. Here is some of the most remarkable ones:
* **Devoted:** This was a solo project and it involved fetching a RSS Feed from a server and creating a list of devotionals that users can read online and offline. The project was done for Android and it involved using external libraries such as _Picasso_.
