I left my country when I was 16 years old to pursue my dreams. I graduate in May 2015, and I can look back and say I have been living my dream! Getting a high-school and college education in America has been an amazing experience.

Now, I have always been a big Math nerd and I always saw myself in the math field. That was until I took one programming class and found that my passion was not limited to just Math. Exploring the world of Computer Science has been very enlightening and now I am very interested in Android and web development.

I enjoy the outdoors and soccer, but nothing beats reading a good article, book, or solving that problem that kept me awake all night! My dream has just started and I am ready to get out there to solve, code, and explore.
