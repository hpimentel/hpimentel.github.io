I left my country when I was 16 years old to pursue an American education. I graduate in May 2015 and I've had an amazing experience so far.

Now, I have always been a big Math fan and I always saw myself in the math field. That was until I took one programming class and found that my passion was not limited to just Math. Exploring the world of Computer Science has been very enlightening and now I am very interested in Android and web development.

I enjoy the outdoors and soccer, but nothing beats reading a good article, book, or solving that problem that kept me awake all night! My dream has just started and I am ready to get out there to solve, code, and explore.
